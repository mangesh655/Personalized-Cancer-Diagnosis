# Personalized-Cancer-Diagnosis

## Business Problem/Problem Statement ##
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) launched this competition, accepted by the NIPS 2017 Competition Track,  because we need your help to take personalized medicine to its full potential. Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). 

## Objectives & Constraints ##

### Objectives: ###
Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

### Constraints: ### 
* No low-latency requirement.
* Interpretability is important.
* Errors can be very costly.
* Probability of a data-point belonging to each class is needed.
